The existing LSB Algorithm works as follows:
DATA EMBEDDING
Input: Cover image, stego-key and the text file
Output: stego image
Algorithm:
• Step 1: Extract the pixels of the cover image.
• Step 2: Extract the characters of the text message.
• Step 3: Extract the characters from the Stego key.
• Step 4: Choose first pixel and pick characters of the Stego key and place it in
first component of pixel.
• Step 5: Place some terminating symbol to indicate end of the key. 0 has been
used as a terminating symbol in this algorithm.
• Step 6: Insert characters of text le in each first component of next pixels by
replacing it.
• Step 7: Repeat step 6 till all the characters has been embedded.
• Step 8: Again place some terminating symbol to indicate end of data.
• Step 9: Obtained stego image

DATA EXTRACTION
Input: Stego-image file, stego-key
Output: Secret text message.
Algorithm:
• Step 1: Extract the pixels of the stego image.
• Step 2: Now, start from first pixel and extract stego key characters from
first component of the pixels. Follow Step3 up to terminating symbol,
otherwise follow step 4.
• Step 4: If this extracted key matches with the key entered by the receiver,
then follow Step 5, otherwise terminate the program
• Step 5: If the key is correct, then go to next pixels and extract secret
message
• Characters from first component of next pixels. Follow Step 5 till up to
terminating symbol, otherwise follow step 6.
• Step 6: Extract secret message
